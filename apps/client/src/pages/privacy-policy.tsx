ðŸ“œ Privacy Policy

<br></br>
<br></br>
Effective Date: [14/04/2025]<br></br>
<br></br>


1. Information We Collect
We collect minimal data. Specifically:

Messages that users submit via the platform (temporarily stored).

Tokens associated with each message (used for retrieval).

Basic server logs (e.g., IP address, time of access) for security and debugging.
<br></br>
<br></br>
2. How We Use Your Data
Store messages temporarily for token-based retrieval.

Automatically delete messages after they expire.

Monitor platform usage to maintain performance and security.
<br></br>
<br></br>
3. Data Retention
Messages are automatically deleted after [e.g., 5 minutes] or once they are retrieved.
<br></br>
<br></br>
4. Third Parties
We donâ€™t share your data with anyone. No tracking, no ads, no external analytics.
<br></br>
<br></br>
5. Your Rights
Since we donâ€™t store personal information, thereâ€™s nothing you need to request access to. If you want to ensure your message is gone, just wait for it to expire â€” or donâ€™t share sensitive info at all.
<br></br>
<br></br>
6. Changes
We might update this policy. If we do, weâ€™ll post the new version here.
